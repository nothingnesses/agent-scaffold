## Motivations

- Setting up the workflow by hand for each project is repetitive: the same planning-document skeleton, the same guidance/principles, the same reusable prompts, and (when wanted) the same worktree and container isolation.
- The setup should work in two modes: starting a new project, and adding to or editing an existing one. A greenfield-only template does not cover the second mode.
- The default should be minimal. Extra machinery (diagram prompt packs, container isolation, language starters) should be opt-in rather than imposed.
- Guidance should be harness-agnostic: `AGENTS.md` is the canonical file, with any harness-specific file (for example `CLAUDE.md`) reduced to a thin pointer to it.
